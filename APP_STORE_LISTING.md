## NOTES

- App handle is still `insightops` (apps.shopify.com/insightops) — can't change without Shopify support
- App name in shopify.app.toml needs updating before `shopify app deploy`
- Old screencast video needs replacing
- Removed all: staff accountability, audit log positioning, sales analytics, attribution language
- Fully aligned with: protection, monitoring, revenue safety
